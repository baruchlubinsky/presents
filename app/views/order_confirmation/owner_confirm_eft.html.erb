	Hi Pammi-Joy
</p>
<p>
	We just received a new order for:
	<ul>
	<% @order.order_items.each do |i| %>
		<li><%= "#{i.name} from #{i.shop}. #{i.note}" %></li>
	<% end %>
	</ul>
	from <%= @customer.name %>.
</p>
<p>
	Pay by EFT.
</p>
<p>
	Please remember to check that you have received the money, even if the system has registered a payment.
</p>
<p>
	Yay, for a sale! Well done.<br/>
	Raj
